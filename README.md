# VulkanDraft
Sandbox ready to play with Vulkan. I am going to practise here my Vulkan skills before implementing it in my engine.
Engine project can be found in here: [BIGOS](https://github.com/3MGit/BIGOS)

## Getting Started
Instal Vulkan SDK in default directory: C:\VulkanSDK. 
Probably you will need to change version in Visual Studio Solution project properties.
